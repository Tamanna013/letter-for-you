# 💌 Letter for You
A beautifully animated love letter surprise built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features an interactive envelope that reveals a heartfelt message and a surprise animation when opened.<br>

## ✨ Overview
"Letter for You" is a web-based romantic surprise that mimics the experience of receiving and opening a love letter. The project consists of:<br>
-- An envelope that opens on hover/click<br>
-- A love letter that slides up to reveal a heartfelt message<br>
-- A heartbeat animation for added effect<br>
-- A surprise page with floating text animations expressing love and admiration<br>
## 🛠 Implementation
### 📌 Technologies Used
-- HTML: Structure of the webpage<br>
-- CSS: Animations, styling, and layout<br>
-- JavaScript: Event handling for interactivity<br>
### 🔍 Logic & Functionality
-- 💌 Envelope Animation<br>
  The envelope is created using CSS pseudo-elements and border properties to form a triangular flap. When the user hovers/clicks, the flap rotates backward (rotateX(160deg)) using CSS transitions. The letter inside slides up (translateY(-130px)) while its opacity increases to become visible.
-- 💓 Heartbeat Effect<br>
  A red heart at the top of the letter pulses using @keyframes animation (scale(1.05 → 1 → 0.8)).
-- 🎉 Surprise Page Animation<br>
  15 different love messages appear randomly on the screen. Each message fades in and out using CSS keyframe animations (opacity and scale). The messages have randomized positions and animation durations to create a dynamic effect.<br><br>
